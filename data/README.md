The basics of downloading and cleaning gtfs data.

## Downloading Data

1. Use `python get_agencies.py` (make sure python is installed or whatever other method you like) to snag a list of all of the agencies with GTFS:

`wget http://www.gtfs-data-exchange.com/api/agencies -O agencies.json`

2. Check for the URL of the most recent GTFS feed for your agency of choice

`wget http://www.gtfs-data-exchange.com/api/agency?agency=metropolitan-atlanta-rapid-transit-authority -O marta.json`

3. Download that feed!

`wget http://gtfs.s3.amazonaws.com/metropolitan-atlanta-rapid-transit-authority_20140115_0110.zip -O gtfs.zip`

## Validating Data

* Reasons not to check data
  * You really trust the tech folks at the agency
  * Youâ€™re ok with hitting possible errors
* Reasons to check
  * Sometimes people put weird stuff in GTFS
    * Nested folders
    * pdf license agreements
  * Sometimes the data is super messy
  * Measure twice, cut once?
  * One other reason: https://github.com/OneBusAway/onebusaway-application-modules/wiki/Developer-Guide#common-problems-building-bundle
